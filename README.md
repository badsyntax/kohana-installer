# Kohana Installer

A command line installer for the Kohana source on Github.

Lets you choose a directory to install to, modules to install, and branch to use. Can also install the basic application structure: `index.php`, `bootstrap.php`, etc.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository somewhere.
2. Make `kohana` executable.
3. Symlink `kohana` somewhere in your `$PATH`.

If you are unsure where to create the symlink, use `/usr/local`:

    ln -s kohana /usr/local/kohana

__If you don't know what `$PATH` is, [search Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=bash+path).__ (Some of you are probably thinking "I use ZSH, you insensitive clod!" Well guess what? Most people don't. Get over it.)

## Usage

1. Execute `kohana --help` to show available options.
2. ???
3. Profit.
